twosheds
========

twosheds is a library for making command language interpreters, or shells.

Popular shells are almost exclusively written in C, and therefore are hard to extend.

Most existing shells are written in C which makes extension difficult. Python
is comparatively easy to learn, read, and write, and is fast enough to operate
as a day-to-day shell.
